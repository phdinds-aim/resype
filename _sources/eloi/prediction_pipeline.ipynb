    "We introduce a framework for training arbitrary machine learning models to perform collaborative filtering on small and large datasets. Given the utility matrix as input, we outline two approaches for model training as discussed by C. Aggarwal in his book on *Recommender Systems*. We also propose an extension of these methodologies by applying clustering on the dataset before the model training. "

    "The diagram below shows the flowchart of the proposed method for model training. If the dataset is small (left branch), we use the two approaches metioned above and apply them to the raw utility matrix. Since we are training one model per item, a limitation of these methods is that they are computationally expensive especially when the iterative approach is used. Hence we need a more scalable solution. One way to do this assigning users and/or items into clusters and deriving a new utility matrix that contains the representative ratings per cluster.  "
